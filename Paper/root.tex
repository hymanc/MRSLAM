\begin{abstract}

In this paper we present and implement the algorithm in Howard's 2006 paper: ``Multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping using particle filters.''  While Howard's method is attractive for its speed, it only uses a single particle filter for all the robots which can result in undesired particle error and depletion.  In this paper we propose a modification of the algorithm to using independent particle filters for each robot, and demonstrate the efficacy of the technique on a simulated data set.
